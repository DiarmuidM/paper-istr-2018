## Abstract
Encouraged by ‘open data’ movements, regulators have made it increasingly straightforward for stakeholders to access large-scale data about charities and their regulation. This research leverages some of these data resources to examine a topic of considerable public and regulatory importance: charity dissolution due to mission accomplishment. The charity sector's claim to exist for the public good is no longer assumed and must be evidenced, however little is known about the extent to which charities accomplish their missions. In this paper we describe continuing work to collect, clean, harmonise and analyse international data on charity dissolution. In doing so we identify real opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration, combining accounting, social policy, law and data science in order to address important questions in novel ways.

## Pre-requisites

You must have Python and Stata installed on your machine. Python is an open source programming language that can be downloaded and installed using the [Anaconda distribution](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python).
Stata is a proprietary statistical software package and you must [purchase a licence](https://www.stata.com/products/which-stata-is-right-for-me/) to use it. You may be able to reproduce most of the Stata commands using an open source alternative: [gretl](http://gretl.sourceforge.net/).

We recommended using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) to write and run the Python scripts, but there are other text editors/IDEs available.

## Final comments

This materials in this repository are free to use, adapt and share. The data collection, cleaning and analysis scripts are in "beta" phase, meaning they are not likely free of error and should continue to be tested by multiple users. This repository is likely to be updated on a semi-regular basis. If you would like to collaborate on developing the repository further, or have an idea for a research project employing these datasets, then don't hesitate to get in [contact](d.mcdonnell.1@bham.ac.uk).
