## Abstract
Until recently, relatively little nonprofit regulatory data was shared beyond lists of registered charities. Encouraged by increasing 'open data' movements, and in some cases government commitments to greater data sharing, it is becoming increasingly easier to access a range of both quantitative and qualitative data about charities and their regulation on a large scale. This paper describes continuing work to collect, clean, harmonise and analyse international data on charity de-registrations, specifically instances where organisations voluntarily relinquish their charitable status. We evaluate whether there is added value from adopting a cross-national approach and the extent to which other jurisdictions could be included in the analysis.
